I went in expecting to have a lot of fun, but to be underwhelmed by the "touristy" destination. But it turns out that there's a reason for its popularity. There's something that's a lot of fun on every island, and they're all just a 2 or 3 hour sail away.</p><p>The highlight of the trip, of course, was welcoming our first on board visitors. Many good times were had.</p><p>We ticked all of the must stop places:<br><br>Bitter End Yacht Club -- beautifully rebuilt and landscaped since the hurricane several years back.<br><br>Anagada, where all of the boats packed into a mooring field, leaving us a nice anchorage at Pomato Point. Sid's was some of the best food on the whole trip.</p><p>We hit Foxy's and stayed out late dancing to the DJ. We spent a day on the beautiful beach in front of the Soggy Dollar Bar, where they invented the painkiller.<br><br>I always come back from the islands with the notion that I'm going to make painkillers at home, and I always forget about it.</p><p>Willy T's was more fun than I remember. It's an old barge, styled as a pirate ship, where people definitely never jump off the upper deck into the beautiful water below. And they especially never ever jump off the upper deck naked, even though there's a t-shirt to celebrate such an achievement.<br><br>We visited The Baths, a natural formation of rock that makes cool wading pools and is one of the places that one really must visit.</p><p>There were only two drawbacks. First was the maddening crowds of charter boats. We mostly counter-programmed our visits to be away from the weekend to weekend charter itinerary, but it's still a master class in which vessel should stand on and which should give way. And they do love to drop an anchor right on top of where you're swinging!</p><p>The other drawback was that we went down a head (boat toilet). Someone flushed something that was neither toilet paper nor excrement, and the pump that grinds it to a liquid and discharges it couldn't handle the load. In the previous Velvet Elvis, this would have been a disaster, but fortunately, we now have a 2nd head to use for backup.</p><p>Again, all of the fun is documented over in <a href="/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/">the photos</a>, but here are a few to whet your appetite.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Friends in town" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Friends in town</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Anagada" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Anagada</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Jost Van Dyke" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Jost Van Dyke</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The Baths" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" alt="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">The Baths</span></a></div></article><footer><nav><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div><p>Â© 2023 - 2025 <a href="https://sailvelvetelvis.com">sailvelvetelvis.com</a></p><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
