We kept moving along the southern Spanish coast in reasonable winds. But the winds had just been really blowing for several days, and the sea state was still pretty agressive.</p><p>By morning, we came to realize that we had some damage. We stopped at Almiramar, where we had planned to stop for a day or two anyway. But instead of leaving, we went ahead and had the boat hauled out of the water for inspection. We found a problem with the potential to be quite serious.</p><p>The good people from Pegasus were on site to help in a day, and they sent a team of experts from their shop with a truck full of supplies immediately. There are three guys working every hour of daylight right now, and we're optimistic about getting back underway next week.</p><p>Meanwhile, we play tourist in Almiramar. There's a huge English-speaking contingent here, and everyone has been very nice. The town is basically a giant zig-zagging marina, surrounded by probably 3 miles of bars and restaurants, and then those surrounded by apartment buildings. There are lots of parks, and the weather is sunny and nice. Each end of town ends in a large beach, but the water is still pretty cold. We're getting a lot of work and school done. But that's about it: work/school, check on the boat, go for dinner and cocktails. There's really not a lot more to do.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I've definitely seen uglier boat yards." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">I've definitely seen uglier boat yards.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240315_141800_D3093609-5AB6-4864-AE23-CADBFE324A11.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We rented an apartment for our stay.
