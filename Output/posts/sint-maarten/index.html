There's no real border. You can just pop back and forth and at some point, the language and the currencies change on you.</p><p>We were mostly in a marina in Dutch Sint Maarten. We spent days on minor repairs and major cleaning, getting <em>Velvet Elvis</em> ready for the leg of the journey with more visitors. The marina itself is great. It's the third of the IGY branded marinas we've stayed at (they should have a rewards program), and it was definitely the nicest.<br><br>They sent an escort dinghy out to lead us through the drawbridge, show us to the fuel dock, and lead us to our slip. When I didn't line up the boat just exactly right, the dinghy became a little tug and pushed us exactly where we needed to be.</p><p>Then, there's a pretty nice pool on a rooftop with a view, where you can bluetooth in to nice sounding speakers. It was a great break after boat work.</p><p>A fun little bar by the entrance to the marina was also a good place to wind down and chat it up with the locals.</p><p>We ventured by dinghy to France, and we didn't really give it a fair shake, but I didn't see anything that was worth the excursion. We went for brunch and found some good crepes and a grocery that filled a void that was left by the grocery closer to the marina.</p><p>Boat supplies are abundant. Sint Maarten would be a great place to stage trips, as there's so much there, and there are so many great sailing destinations a day away.</p><p>I didn't take a whole lot of pictures...</p><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Americanized restaurants" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Americanized restaurants</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Kid's bonfire at a tourist trap with surprisingly good food." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Kid's bonfire at a tourist trap with surprisingly good food.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Boat work" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Boat work</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Headed to France" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Headed to France</span></a></div></article><footer><nav><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div><p>Â© 2023 - 2024 <a href="https://sailvelvetelvis.com">sailvelvetelvis.com</a></p><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
