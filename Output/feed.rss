They have various degrees of convenience and amenities, but all of them are a step down when compared to our quarters aboard the boat.</p><p>We have mostly just been doing work, school, and streaming American TV. We wander the town, and we're a little tired of every bar and restaurant. We've come to know a healthy percentage of the local British population, just from happening to be seated near them at cocktail hour one night or another. Last Thursday, we went to a random going away party, and it happened to be an outgoing dog lover who had introduced herself to Rosie and then to the rest of us at a different place earlier in the stay.</p><p>The wind continues to blow us away, in both the literal and figurative senses. We turned the Pegasus crew loose to make their way home after they had worked around the clock for 10 days or so, leaving me to roll on a couple of coats of bottom paint. I did it in the wind, and the gale would lift sheets of paint up out of my paint tray and blow it over my head and face. Last Tuesday, I was too paint-covered to drop in and see my Scottish friend perform at the Irish Pub's open mic night.</p><p>Easter weekend brought our first real rain, and we huddled in our tiniest apartment to watch movies. I'm not sure if it's one of our most memorable or least memorable Easters.</p><p>We should be able to put in on April Fool's day and get moving again after a day of sail-hoisting and cleanup.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240322_220041_2389FB71-5741-4E34-B019-F54A7CF4E173_1_105_c.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Killing time at the British Pub, the Stumble Inn." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240322_220041_2389FB71-5741-4E34-B019-F54A7CF4E173_1_105_c.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240322_220041_2389FB71-5741-4E34-B019-F54A7CF4E173_1_105_c.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Killing time at the British Pub, the Stumble Inn.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240323_180050_926483A2-66A3-4B45-9FE7-F3FE72A7A27B_1_105_c.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Blowing like hell." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240323_180050_926483A2-66A3-4B45-9FE7-F3FE72A7A27B_1_105_c.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240323_180050_926483A2-66A3-4B45-9FE7-F3FE72A7A27B_1_105_c.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Blowing like hell.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240324_140648_8AF3D072-6D9F-47B2-A9A8-6E3CCC8645FB_1_105_c.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Saharan dust blowing in with the wind storm.

We kept moving along the southern Spanish coast in reasonable winds. But the winds had just been really blowing for several days, and the sea state was still pretty agressive.</p><p>By morning, we came to realize that we had some damage. We stopped at Almiramar, where we had planned to stop for a day or two anyway. But instead of leaving, we went ahead and had the boat hauled out of the water for inspection. We found a problem with the potential to be quite serious.</p><p>The good people from Pegasus were on site to help in a day, and they sent a team of experts from their shop with a truck full of supplies immediately. There are three guys working every hour of daylight right now, and we're optimistic about getting back underway next week.</p><p>Meanwhile, we play tourist in Almiramar. There's a huge English-speaking contingent here, and everyone has been very nice. The town is basically a giant zig-zagging marina, surrounded by probably 3 miles of bars and restaurants, and then those surrounded by apartment buildings. There are lots of parks, and the weather is sunny and nice. Each end of town ends in a large beach, but the water is still pretty cold. We're getting a lot of work and school done. But that's about it: work/school, check on the boat, go for dinner and cocktails. There's really not a lot more to do.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I've definitely seen uglier boat yards." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">I've definitely seen uglier boat yards.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240315_141800_D3093609-5AB6-4864-AE23-CADBFE324A11.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We rented an apartment for our stay.

On Saturday, we stopped into a sardine festival, intending to stay an hour or two, but actually ending up making a day of it. While eating, we chatted up a lady who had moved from the US to Ibiza as a baby with expat parents, and she told us where to drive for the big time scenery.</p><p>On Sunday, we did that drive, and even a little hike.

It's like Miami, if a huge road construction project and windy, cool weather caused a lot of the businesses to close for a bit. You can get anything you want there -- boat services, Indian food, night club action, herpes (presumably). We found a place with excellent food and Sangria, and passed a pleasant few days waiting for a good weather window.</p><p>We chose to leave on a Friday night where the forecast was for 20 knot winds on our beam. It turned out to be a night with 25 knots on the bow, which is a much, much more unpleasant sailing experience. But we plowed through the night with a double-reefed main and a bit of jib flying, with winds gusting to 30.</p><p>The seas kicked up, and it was uncomfortable and annoying, We had some miscommunication about who was latching hatches, so it was also wetter inside the boat than it should be. The waves were enough to spray up over the cabin fairly regularly.</p><p>Here's how it looked from the chart table in the middle of the night. Volume up, if you're where you can.</p><iframe width="872" height="491" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLhMsYtoRgQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Around sunrise, I was just getting up to end my night watch, and the auto pilot went out. We were still 20 miles away from Ibiza, and the wind was still coming from the direction we needed at an insane speed. I started the motor, and we plowed into the chop, hand steering through the cold salt spay for four hours.</p><p>When we arrived, we found that the anchor had shaken loose in storm and pounded the shit out of our bow. Our formerly beautifully painted bow. The shaking had also ripped the door to the forwardmost cabin right out of its frame.<br><br>It's been cold and windy in Ibiza, which doesn't help with the frustration. But in just a few days, we've made a lot of progress on repairs and cleanup, and in a couple more days, we'll be able to move along. A fiberglass guy is going to patch us up "good enough" so that we can move on safely, and then when we're in a place that's warmer and cheaper, we can haul out to complete the repair, sanding, and painting.</p><p>Most of my latest pictures are close ups of hull damage and steering mechanisms.

The marina in Riposto is right by where the the catch comes in every morning, and so just a block down and to the right is market after market of fresh fish right off the boat. We ate tuna and swordfish pretty much every day.</p><p>There was also good produce right there, along with butcher shops, bakeries, and miscellaneous stores with meats and cheeses. I suspect the neighborhood is still abuzz about how much food the American family with teenage boys bought while in town. One lady was shocked -- like, "are you sure you want that much?" -- when I ordered about a pound of mortadella.<br><br>One afternoon, after the fresh markets were closed and I was looking to stock up on wine, a car slowed down near me on the street. Out of the window popped the guy from the produce stand where I had gone three days in a row, and the guy's big booming baritone rang out, "Hello my friend!"</p><p>I hope the local grocery economy will recover quickly now that we are gone.</p><p>(More text after some Sicily photos)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1562.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1562.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1562.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1584.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1584.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1584.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1629.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The size of these peppers!" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1629.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1629.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">The size of these peppers!</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1641.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="If you travel to Sicily, definitely take a tourist boat out to see it from the sea.

We bashed into the wind all day. The sailing wasn't fun, so we tucked into a little cover on a small volcano north of Sicily and got a good night's sleep, followed by a great sail the next day. Another day yet, and we were to Sardinia.</p><p>We chose a marina in a quiet little town that is mostly shut down for the winter. We took a taxi into town and had a five-star meal, but other than that, it was mostly boat chores and laundry. Very pretty though, and it shows signs of being a happening place during the high season.</p><p>(Even more text after these pictures)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Leaving on Saturday, we had ideal conditions for putting out the Code 0 (big, giant downwind sail at the very front of the boat). But I neglected to get any practice on closed-loop furlers, and as I pulled out sail, the furling mechanism was wrapping itself around the sail instead of just unfurling line like a drum furler would have. V and I went forward to get things untangled. but the wind had a good grip on the bit of the sail that had gotten let out. I asked for the boat to be steered into the wind so that the sail would luff, and when the boat turned, it went right over one of the sheets on that sail that was half deployed.</p><p>If you sailed to Cuba with us, or if you heard tales of our Cuba trip, this will sound familiar to you.</p><p>The line got caught in the prop (of course), which means no more motoring. We dropped the big sail to the deck and bungeed it into an ugly bundle. Then, under main sail alone, we sailed close to a pretty little beach and dropped anchor.</p><p>We had to find all of the components of the hookah dive system. I had secretly hoped to never use it again.</p><p>And the best advice that we got before leaving for this trip was to go buy a used wetsuit, just in case.</p><p>We got things sorted, and it took me forever to work up the nerve to swim under water. I kept going under and finding that I couldn't breathe. Eventually, it dawned on me that I was clenching my jaw so tight that I wasn't letting any air out.</p><p>The line wasn't on tight. I just had to unwrap it, maybe seven or eight times. I wasn't under the boat more than 75 seconds or so, probably, but I was nervous like I was diving a blue hole.</p><p>After that, we had a couple of drinks and enjoyed being anchored on a warm afternoon. Then, we put all of the gear back away, wrestled the sail and tangled lines into storage, and set off again. I'm tying this at 4:00 AM local time, and our beautiful weather window is over. There's no wind out here at all.</p><p>At some point, I'll do some technical videos about our sail rigging, but I have a lot left to learn first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/underway</guid><title>Underway</title><description>We shove off and set sail for home.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/underway</link><pubDate>Tue, 6 Feb 2024 14:31:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday morning, we finished buttoning up the boat, motored to the Izola fuel dock, and then motored over to the nearby town of Portrose to officially export the boat from Slovenia.

We had chartered similar boats, and we were excited to do some coastal cruising on our own schedule. As we grew our confidence, we started overnight passages and then venturing farther and farther offshore. And we might have sailed it a bit harder than she was meant to be sailed. Not in a dangerous way, but in the way of robustness.</p><p>I see that clearly now that we've moved aboard Hazagussa, the red Pegasus that you saw briefly in the last post. The Pegasus components -- sailing hardware especially, but pumps, hatches, and all sorts of minor pieces too look and feel so much bigger and sturdier.</p><p>The list of things that I never had to troubleshoot, replace, or repair on the Beneteau is as follows:</p><ul><li>any of the winches</li><li>water heater</li><li>a little pump at the bottom of the freezer to remove meltwater. However, the freezer was broken as often as not, so this pump didn't get put through the paces like the rest of the boat.</li></ul><p>So it's a little bit funny that the boat thing I've done most since we moved aboard is troubleshoot the water heater.</p><p>For most of us, it's not a big deal, because we're at the dock, and hot showers are a short walk away.<br><br>But I don't think I've written yet that one of our capable and able crew, namely Heather, is somewhat less capable with a broken ankle. The marina has accommodated us by allowing us to pull side-to on a long floating dock rather than make her try to cross a gangway. But getting on and off is an adventure, and it's not been the best weather, so she opted for an ice water shower.</p><p>Other than the hot water thing, living aboard again is so great. The salon is big and full of light, and we're all in here without being on top of each other during the rainy days. The cat has find a way to squirm under the salon table, and he has himself a little spot that floats him above strands of cabling. We'll have to put a blanket in that spot for him on Velvet Elvis.</p><p>We even cooked home made food yesterday for the first time since we arrived.</p><p>As I write, it's blowing out there:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32.</span></a><iframe width="1034" height="582" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeep-JfdU-g" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_100038_IMG_1314.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This is one of my favorite pictures that I've ever taken.

We're looking at some time next week before she's in the water, and then there's still a lot to do before we can put Slovenia behind us. But that's the nature of travel, and in particular of sailing. We definitely want everything to be right on the boat first.</p><p>We've gotten to go to the shop and do a lot of technical learning, and seeing how everything is being assembled is invaluable. And we have a company where the owners know where every wire is run and every hose is plumbed, and they seem eager to stay on the phone with us and get us where we want to be when we want to be there. Better yet, they know where to go in the Med and where to skip. It will be great to have them as a remote team helping us from shore.</p><p>We also met the owner of hull 9, <strong>Sine Finis</strong> which launched last week. Nice guy. He's going to leave it here and let us import into the US before following later in the year. I'm sure we'll see hime again.</p><p>Continuing the bad news, we've all been fighting a mild sickness. Fucking air travel. The up side of that is that we just sleep in our rental place, which I've named "the world's most dismal apartment." Tomorrow is move out day. I'll leave the details about where we're going for later in the week.<br><br>My pictures are a weird mix of tourist and technical. Here's a pretty mountain. Here's a compressor for the cockpit refrigerator. Here's the dog looking cute on a Pegasus that is not our Pegasus. I'm a bit at a loss for what to post.</p><p>I think I'm going to do some technical walk-through videos for the real nerds out there once we're aboard our own boat, so I'll save some of those pictures for then.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" data-lightview-caption="How's that for a transom?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-01.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">How's that for a transom?</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-02.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Izola is a really pretty town." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-03.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Izola is a really pretty town.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-04.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Velvet Elvis's keel" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-05.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Velvet Elvis's keel</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/game-plan</guid><title>Game Plan</title><description>It's almost go time.

Here's our plan for the next couple of weeks. Send good vibes for cooperating weather.</p><p>Jan 8: We arrive in Slovenia. Rent car, check in to apartment, buy cat litter.</p><p>Jan 9: Boat school starts. Go to Kranj to see <em>Velvet Elvis</em> in person and start learning her systems. Boat school continues with combinations of visits to the boat yard and on board a sister ship in the marina at Izola.</p><p>Jan 12: Keel arrives at boat yard from the keel manufacturer. Ours is the first Pegasus with the shoal draft keel. This delivery is somewhat delayed, but the good folks at Pegasus are planning to keep it in the shop and do its prep work over the weekend.</p><p>Jan 15: Transport the boat to the ocean. This should be a big day with some good pictures.</p><p>Jan 16th &amp; 17th: Install keel, step the mast, install rigging, and get the boat into the water. Maybe not in that order.</p><p>Once the boat's in the water, we can start unloading the pallets of our stuff that we shipped up there and moving into the boat. We can also get to the starlink dish at this point and get it installed. We also start a series of test sails where we make sure everything is working, instruments are calibrated, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</guid><title>More Photos From the Build</title><description>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</link><pubDate>Thu, 7 Dec 2023 14:36:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2748.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Main cabin is coming along.

Things that they can cut out a lot of for several boats at a time.</p><p>Some time during August or September, our hull showed up in the shop. At that point, it was just a boat shaped mass of fiber.
