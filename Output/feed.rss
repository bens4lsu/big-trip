We're looking at some time next week before she's in the water, and then there's still a lot to do before we can put Slovenia behind us. But that's the nature of travel, and in particular of sailing. We definitely want everything to be right on the boat first.</p><p>We've gotten to go to the shop and do a lot of technical learning, and seeing how everything is being assembled is invaluable. And we have a company where the owners know where every wire is run and every hose is plumbed, and they seem eager to stay on the phone with us and get us where we want to be when we want to be there. Better yet, they know where to go in the Med and where to skip. It will be great to have them as a remote team helping us from shore.</p><p>We also met the owner of hull 9, <strong>Sine Finis</strong> which launched last week. Nice guy. He's going to leave it here and let us import into the US before following later in the year. I'm sure we'll see hime again.</p><p>Continuing the bad news, we've all been fighting a mild sickness. Fucking air travel. The up side of that is that we just sleep in our rental place, which I've named "the world's most dismal apartment." Tomorrow is move out day. I'll leave the details about where we're going for later in the week.<br><br>My pictures are a weird mix of tourist and technical. Here's a pretty mountain. Here's a compressor for the cockpit refrigerator. Here's the dog looking cute on a Pegasus that is not our Pegasus. I'm a bit at a loss for what to post.</p><p>I think I'm going to do some technical walk-through videos for the real nerds out there once we're aboard our own boat, so I'll save some of those pictures for then.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" data-lightview-caption="How's that for a transom?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-01.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">How's that for a transom?</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-02.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Izola is a really pretty town." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-03.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Izola is a really pretty town.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-04.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Velvet Elvis's keel" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-05.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Velvet Elvis's keel</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/game-plan</guid><title>Game Plan</title><description>It's almost go time.

Here's our plan for the next couple of weeks. Send good vibes for cooperating weather.</p><p>Jan 8: We arrive in Slovenia. Rent car, check in to apartment, buy cat litter.</p><p>Jan 9: Boat school starts. Go to Kranj to see <em>Velvet Elvis</em> in person and start learning her systems. Boat school continues with combinations of visits to the boat yard and on board a sister ship in the marina at Izola.</p><p>Jan 12: Keel arrives at boat yard from the keel manufacturer. Ours is the first Pegasus with the shoal draft keel. This delivery is somewhat delayed, but the good folks at Pegasus are planning to keep it in the shop and do its prep work over the weekend.</p><p>Jan 15: Transport the boat to the ocean. This should be a big day with some good pictures.</p><p>Jan 16th &amp; 17th: Install keel, step the mast, install rigging, and get the boat into the water. Maybe not in that order.</p><p>Once the boat's in the water, we can start unloading the pallets of our stuff that we shipped up there and moving into the boat. We can also get to the starlink dish at this point and get it installed. We also start a series of test sails where we make sure everything is working, instruments are calibrated, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</guid><title>More Photos From the Build</title><description>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</link><pubDate>Thu, 7 Dec 2023 14:36:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2748.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Main cabin is coming along.

They were things like rudders and sections of bulkhead and interior walls. Things that they can cut out a lot of for several boats at a time.</p><p>Some time during August or September, our hull showed up in the shop. At that point, it was just a boat shaped mass of fiber. They start laying in bulkheads and interior walls and start running the hundreds of miles of cabling and wiring, adding water tanks and waste tanks and plumbing, and all of the hundreds of other things that start turning it in to the boat it will be.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2024%20Medium.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Velvet Elvis in the Yard, September 20, 2023" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2024%20Medium.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2024 Medium.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Velvet Elvis in the Yard, September 20, 2023</span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2029%20Medium.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Inside the hull" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2029%20Medium.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2029 Medium.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Inside the hull</span></a><p>On October 27, enough was done to join the deck to the hull</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2276%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2276%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2276 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2282%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2282%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2282 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2283%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2283%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2283 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>As I understand that process, there is much lowering and raising, then sanding and fairing to make sure everything fits together just right.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2284%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2284%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2284 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2287%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2287%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2287 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Meanwhile, we were selecting flooring and fabrics for the interior.

It might seem a little aggressive, but I think there will be some cool things. First, a lot of the instruments live mounted on those surfaces, so they will seem just to float over the surface of the boat itself. Second, some of the sight lines from the cockpit look through the salon glass, and with black, we shouldn't really get any glare from this surface no matter what the light is like.</p><p>Cockpit cushions will be similar, except that the throw pillows will be gold, to better match the trim of the boat itself.</p><p>This isn't her, of course, but this is a render of what a black hull with gold trim should look like.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/color-render-1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/color-render-1.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/color-render-1.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/VelvetElvis_transom.png" data-lightview-caption="And from behind" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/VelvetElvis_transom.png" alt="/img/bigtrip/VelvetElvis_transom.png" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">And from behind</span></a><p>This week, they're actually going to be painting.
