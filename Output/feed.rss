When we arrived, hurricane Beryl had just passed 100 miles to the south, and I think the storm's approach lead all of the airplane tourists to cancel their vacations. The result was us having the run of the place to ourselves.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240704_134336_IMG_3636.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Pool to ourselves" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240704_134336_IMG_3636.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240704_134336_IMG_3636.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Pool to ourselves</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240705_083506_IMG_3646.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Lots of starfish" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240705_083506_IMG_3646.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240705_083506_IMG_3646.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Lots of starfish</span></a><p>We spent a couple of days doing boat work, refreshing the laundry, and drinking pina coladas at an empty infinity pool looking out over the bay. Then, we rented a car and checked out a town about an hour away. Before we left, we anchored on the south side of the bay at a national park, where we spent some time checking out caves and failing to find some of the other attractions.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Cave exploring" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Cave exploring</span></a><p>Our final stop was off the coast of Playa Cayo Levantado, informally known as Bicardi Island. Depending on the source of information, the Bicardi corporation owned the island, or filmed its commercials there, or both. It is the spot over there with the pretty turquoise water, and it had some pretty beaches. Off the beaches were full of vendors catoring to tourists with food, drinks, tourist trap souvenirs, and Cuban cigars.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Bicardi Island" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Bicardi Island</span></a><p>We had a minor mishap where we were hurrying back to Velvet Elvis from the island, and we couldn't get the dinghy motor to start. We ended up paddling back, and when I pulled out the keys to unlock the door, the dinghy's kill switch fell out with it. We had forgotten to reconnect it, and that's why we had to paddle.</p><p>A friendly Canadian (redundant) had motored up to offer us a tow back to our boat. He was a little too late to help, but we had a beer and some good conversation to cap off our stay.</p><p>The waves were still way up when we left. It was a few days' sailing to Great Inagua in the Bahamas. The cost of properly clearing in didn't make sense for our planned one-night stay, so we hung out on anchor. We met the people on the only other boat there, and they scouted the island and couldn't find a restaurant open for the off season anyway.<br><br>From Great Inagua, we sailed another couple of days to the Raggad Islands, where we held up at a beautiful beach that we had to ourselves. A maintained hut tells the tale of visiting cruisers during the high season, but the single boat we saw at Great Inagua was infinitely more than the number of boats sharing this anchorage with us.</p><p>One more mishap here: after lots of succesful flights, I finally missed the landing with the drone. A gust of wind, a tiny roll on a wave, and it teetered on the transom before falling into the deep. It kept broadcasting a picture. I retrieved it from the bottom and got the battery out as quickly as I could, but it never did recover.</p><p>Two more days of sailing brought us to another pretty spit of sand with turquoise water, also controlled by the Bahamas, but this one was even more desolate, without a Bahamian civilization within a hundred miles.</p><p>When we pulled up the anchor at this island, it would be the last time that we churned up another nation's sand. It was homeward to Key West.</p><p>A few more pics from the Bahamas:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hog Cay, Raggads" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Hog Cay, Raggads</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Island to ourselves" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Island to ourselves</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/usvi-and-puerto-rico</guid><title>USVIs and Puerto Rico</title><description>After Crystal and her delightful adult daughters left us, we sailed to Saint John to meet up with some of our Baton Rouge friends.

It was nothing special. I'm sure St. Thomas has some great anchorages. Yet another place where we need to spend more time.</p><p>The next day, we jumped into high waves and pounded our way to Vieques, Puerto Rico. Sarah and Rick met us there, and it was much like St. John -- float at <em>Velvet Elvis</em>, float at a rental house with a view of the sea, and explore a little.<br><br>We had a long and fun stop at a rum distillery. It had a beautiful outdoor bar overlooking lush greenery and wild horses. There was a little stand there with pretty good food. And the rum was okay too.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/190%2520-%2520USVI%2520and%2520Puerto%2520Rico/resIMG_20240628_112326_IMG_3462.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Rum Tasting" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/190%2520-%2520USVI%2520and%2520Puerto%2520Rico/resIMG_20240628_112326_IMG_3462.jpg" alt="/img/gal/190%20-%20USVI%20and%20Puerto%20Rico/resIMG_20240628_112326_IMG_3462.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Rum Tasting</span></a><p>On our last day, our friend JC flew over to join the crew. JC, Kolya, and I did the kayak tour of the bioluminescent bay. I thought this was just amazing. You would swing your hand through the water, and it would light up with a streak of green light, as if you were a wizard. The kayaks had clear bottoms, so as you paddled through, you got a light show of sparkles under your legs the whole way.</p><p>There wasn't really much more to it than that, but it did feel like magic, and I could have stayed longer.</p><p>We sailed from Vieques to Culebra, another Puerto Rican island that is not Puerto Rico. It was like Vieques, but greener, prettier, and by all appearances, more wealthy. We spent a day walking around the town and taking the dinghy to bar and grill type spots. I like this island quite a bit.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/190%2520-%2520USVI%2520and%2520Puerto%2520Rico/resIMG_20240629_173602_IMG_3566.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Rum Tasting" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/190%2520-%2520USVI%2520and%2520Puerto%2520Rico/resIMG_20240629_173602_IMG_3566.jpg" alt="/img/gal/190%20-%20USVI%20and%20Puerto%20Rico/resIMG_20240629_173602_IMG_3566.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Hector the Protector, Culebra Puerto Rico</span></a><p>Our final US Island stop was in San Juan. I had pictured a very large marina with lots of services, but there really isn't that. We grabbed a safe place to anchor as hurricane Beryl passed a hundred miles south and spent a couple of days getting in our steps through Old San Juan. Nothing really to relate there -- just a cool old European-looking city with plenty of food, souvenirs, and bars.</p><p>On the fiasco front, we started having trouble with dinghy fuel. A pinhole on the fuel line had gotten bigger, and jerry-rigged solutions were working less and less. It ended up being a fairly easy repair, where I just cut off the broken bit and reattached the hose, but I'd really like to replace the end that connects to the engine also.</p><p>More concerning was that one of the control pads for the air conditioning went out. We made do my moving the other one back and forth, but then one day, some salt water splashed on the spare and we were down to none. Air conditioning was fun while it lasted.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/190%2520-%2520USVI%2520and%2520Puerto%2520Rico/resIMG_20240701_170545_IMG_3614.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Ice Cream in Old San Juan" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/190%2520-%2520USVI%2520and%2520Puerto%2520Rico/resIMG_20240701_170545_IMG_3614.jpg" alt="/img/gal/190%20-%20USVI%20and%20Puerto%20Rico/resIMG_20240701_170545_IMG_3614.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Ice Cream in Old San Juan</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/bvis</guid><title>BVIs</title><description>The British Virgin Islands are by far the most popular cruising grounds in the Caribbean.

I went in expecting to have a lot of fun, but to be underwhelmed by the "touristy" destination. But it turns out that there's a reason for its popularity. There's something that's a lot of fun on every island, and they're all just a 2 or 3 hour sail away.</p><p>The highlight of the trip, of course, was welcoming our first on board visitors. Many good times were had.</p><p>We ticked all of the must stop places:<br><br>Bitter End Yacht Club -- beautifully rebuilt and landscaped since the hurricane several years back.<br><br>Anagada, where all of the boats packed into a mooring field, leaving us a nice anchorage at Pomato Point. Sid's was some of the best food on the whole trip.</p><p>We hit Foxy's and stayed out late dancing to the DJ. We spent a day on the beautiful beach in front of the Soggy Dollar Bar, where they invented the painkiller.<br><br>I always come back from the islands with the notion that I'm going to make painkillers at home, and I always forget about it.</p><p>Willy T's was more fun than I remember. It's an old barge, styled as a pirate ship, where people definitely never jump off the upper deck into the beautiful water below. And they especially never ever jump off the upper deck naked, even though there's a t-shirt to celebrate such an achievement.<br><br>We visited The Baths, a natural formation of rock that makes cool wading pools and is one of the places that one really must visit.</p><p>There were only two drawbacks. First was the maddening crowds of charter boats. We mostly counter-programmed our visits to be away from the weekend to weekend charter itinerary, but it's still a master class in which vessel should stand on and which should give way. And they do love to drop an anchor right on top of where you're swinging!</p><p>The other drawback was that we went down a head (boat toilet). Someone flushed something that was neither toilet paper nor excrement, and the pump that grinds it to a liquid and discharges it couldn't handle the load. In the previous Velvet Elvis, this would have been a disaster, but fortunately, we now have a 2nd head to use for backup.</p><p>Again, all of the fun is documented over in <a href="https://your-website-url.com/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/">the photos</a>, but here are a few to whet your appetite.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Friends in town" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Friends in town</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Anagada" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Anagada</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Jost Van Dyke" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Jost Van Dyke</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%2520-116-.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The Baths" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" alt="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">The Baths</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/sint-maarten</guid><title>Sint Maarten</title><description>Sint Maarten/Saint Martin is two countries on one island, and that's a weird thing.

There's no real border. You can just pop back and forth and at some point, the language and the currencies change on you.</p><p>We were mostly in a marina in Dutch Sint Maarten. We spent days on minor repairs and major cleaning, getting <em>Velvet Elvis</em> ready for the leg of the journey with more visitors. The marina itself is great. It's the third of the IGY branded marinas we've stayed at (they should have a rewards program), and it was definitely the nicest.<br><br>They sent an escort dinghy out to lead us through the drawbridge, show us to the fuel dock, and lead us to our slip. When I didn't line up the boat just exactly right, the dinghy became a little tug and pushed us exactly where we needed to be.</p><p>Then, there's a pretty nice pool on a rooftop with a view, where you can bluetooth in to nice sounding speakers.

We went for brunch and found some good crepes and a grocery that filled a void that was left by the grocery closer to the marina.</p><p>Boat supplies are abundant.

It's a small hunk of rock with fewer than 2000 people calling it home.<br><br>It was a short stop for us, and we were the only cruisers there at all. We took a mooring ball on the leeward side of the island and swam in the afternoon. The next day, we took the dinghy around to clear in and clear out, and once we lost the island's protection from the wind, we found ourselves in a washing-machine of huge waves coming from every direction. It was a bit unsafe and even a bit more scary.</p><p>While we checked in, V found a stranger who hospitably offered to drive us up the steep hill to the nearest town for lunch. The island is lush and green and very pretty. The buildings are well-kept. It definitely deserves more time than we gave it.</p><p>We returned to the boat for more swimming, and almost, that was it.</p><p>The rolling mechanism in our starboard davit broke while we were putting things in order to sail. It didn't really hinder things, but leaving it alone would cause the line to chafe over time. There's also a bolt on the davit arm that keeps it from rotating around, and that has become sheered off. We're still able to use the davits, but it's a little bit of a worry.<br><br>The swimming pictures look scary. But it wasn't frightening there at all. Just sort of dark, with on and off sprinkles.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>And then this video, which just scares the shit out of me, just because of the dark sky and the water-level camera.</p><iframe width="834" height="469" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHX3AaCnKX0" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/statia</guid><title>Statia</title><description>Statia, or St. Eustatius if you prefer, is our first Dutch island.

It's amazing how the Leewards just line up for you and give you a natural path to follow. You barely even need to navigate. You get to the tip of one island, and you can see the next, standing up from the sea in a large blue/green hazy mass.</p><p>Like Martinique, Guadeloupe is just another part of France. They pay in Euros, fly the French Courtesy Flag, and immediately attempt to surrender their country to visiting Germans (kidding). I thought it would just be more of the same as Martinique, but my impression of Guadeloupe is better. (Bear in mind that I've seen relatively little of either place.)</p><p>We stopped first at Terre de Haute, a pretty little town on a pretty little island. We were low on gasoline for the dinghy, and we ran dry about a quarter mile away from the dinghy dock. V and I rowed the rest of the way in, and I'm expecting ripped deltoids to appear any second now.</p><p>It turns out that we had arrived at a tropical French version of Macinac Island. There were actually a few cars, but most traffic was scooter, golf cart, and by foot. The reason is that there isn't a gas station on the island! We were anchored pretty far out, so this was a probleem.</p><p>We walked around doing our tourist thing for a bit, and then found another cruiser who had a couple of gallons of gas to spare. We had enough to get back to Velvet Elvis, and then enough to dinghy over to the next island in the morning for a complete fill up.</p><p>But that night, the rain came, and we still had the drain plug in the dinghy. Our partially empty fuel can floated, rolled over, and deposited the cruiser's generosity into the ocean via the gas tank's air valve.</p><p>We had to weigh anchor, motor to the next island, and then drop anchor in a very pitchy sea and a light rain. A guy who spoke no English was fishing near by, and he motored over and through sign language offered to run us in, saving us the task of dropping the dinghy and rowing through the slop. The sea was rough enough that I very nearly went swimming both when trying to get on and get off of his skiff.</p><p>We retured to our original anchorage and spent more time in the town, but a lot of things were closed (Sunday), and it was still raining.</p><p>From there, we sailed to Bouillante, a resort-y town on the West coast. We went to an island that is part of a protected park and snorkeled amongst a bunch of French tourists who had kayaked over from the main land. The beach there was prettier than the snorkeling, but it was fun nevertheless. On shore that night, we ate pretty well. Guadeloupe can cook!</p><p>The next day, we sailed to Deshaies, on the northwest corner of the main island. The anchorage was beautiful. I got some time to swim and paddle board around the bay, but I never did end up going ashore. H and V confirm that it was another nice little place.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Terre de Haute" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Terre de Haute</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/dominica</guid><title>Dominica</title><description>I implore you to visit soon.

As it turns out, Martinique is a part of France, just like Hawaii is part of the US.</p><p>We checked in to Martinique on May 15. I stayed aboard to work, but the report was that Les Anses-d'Arlet was a nice little town. Rosie and I went ashore the next morning, and found that to be true. There's not much to it, but what there is is nice.</p><p>We didn't do much in Les Anses, or in Martinique generally. After a full day and two nights in that bay, we sailed north along the eastern coast, and we found a little bay to anchor in. Our first choice was near a town with a chandlery (we broke the connector to the gas tank in our dinghy), but we motored around potential anchoring spots, but they just didn't check all of the boxes for comfort and safety.</p><p>We ended up rounding a point and finding a more sheltered spot. It turned out that there was some good snorkeling right there, and i really should have a page of fish and coral to show you, but I didn't take the camera with me on my swim. That evening, sailboat Ella dropped anchor near the coral, and skipper Rob swam over to say hi to the first English speakers he had encountered in a bit. We ended up moving aboard for cocktails, which led to actual story-swapping with other adults for the first time in months. It also led to a fixed gas line, as Rob is something of a McGyver.</p><p>The next day, we sailed some more and stopped at Saint-Pierre. We took a mooring ball near Benevah, a Texas-flagged catamaran. Ella followed us over, and the three crews wore out our English-speaking welcome at the closest beach bar.</p><p>We really didn't go inland at all. And like I mentioned at the top, we didn't do much that was specific to Martinique, other than be treated rudely for our poor attempts to communicate in French. But it was a fun return to a social life, however briefly it lasted.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2591.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie's first step on land in almost a month.

The anchor lights of the other boats blended in with the city lights on shore, but with the help of the radar, we got anchored in a safe calm place with plenty of room to swing without coming close to another boat.</p><p>Morning revealed a pretty little bay. V was so excited to finally be ashore that he was up with me at first light, getting lines ready and putting out fenders. The marina opened at 8:00, and we headed in.</p><p>Even though we were on fumes, the fuel dock wouldn't help us until we checked in to the country. That's weird, but what's even weirder is that they filled us up after we checked out. Can you fill up a boat who is not legally in, or can't you?</p><p>St Lucia is full of people at the ready to scrub your deck, do your laundry, and repair your sails, all of whom we needed. Some are right there helping to tie up the boat. The bad side of that is that everyone has some services to sell you, and they pester you to the point of being irritating. It's also a cash island, so you have the trips to the ATM, which are annoying.</p><p>We worked hard on rigging repairs. I swam the bottom to inspect the hydrogenerator (which was fine) and the bow thrusters (which had giant plastic bag sucked up into its propellers). On Mother's day, we hired a van to drive us around. It's a big, jungly island. Very pretty away from the town, but also a little boring. The tiny fishing villages were neat to see, and at one, we stopped for a beach walk and rum punches.</p><p>On the disaster front, the dinghy that we paid to ship to Slovenia failed miserably before hitting the water. We had it half inflated and were putting in the floors (which float above the pvc bottom), and the glue keeping the bottom attached to the tubes gave up their hold. The seam was huge, and I don't think we would have ever gotten a good hold with the glue.<br><br>Fortunately, one of the island hustlers had seen the dinghy, happened to sell dinghys, and had dropped off a card. With another huge hit to the bank account, we were back in service. Having a dinghy allowed us to tour the town's little shopping restaurant area, where we had some great food, and then visit a beach restaurant the next night, where the food was mediocre, but where it felt more like vacation.</p><p>Here's a funny part: When we bought the dinghy, the guy told us we could go to the shop, they would inflate it up, and then tow us back to our slip. That sounded good, up until the part where they didn't have a towing vessel in the water. They stood on the bank and tried to wave down other boats. V and I shoved off and started paddling, and sure enough, someone pulled up and offered a tow. And unusually for St. Lucia, they didn't tell me how much I owed them for the favor. Thanks, kind stranger.</p><p>As soon as we had rigging repairs completed and the engine and generator serviced (just regular maintenance), we set off. We have a bit of a learning curve regarding how to secure the dinghy to the retractible davits on Velvet Elvis, and at one point, we had the dinghy hanging off sideways out in the ocean. It's always something with us.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/cabo-verde</guid><title>Cabo Verde</title><description>We had a bit of a scare motoring in to Cabo Verde, but once past it, we found a place with a lot to offer.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/cabo-verde</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 03:32:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone feel like it's been a couple of weeks since the latest fiasco?</p><p>We were motoring into the marina at Mindelo, Cabo Verde. Somewhere in the harbor, we caught a fishing net, and as we approached the fuel dock, it got a good wrap on the propeller.</p><p>You probably know that boats don't have breaks. To slow down, we put it in reverse. So when the propeller can't spin, not only do we not have the ability to forward, but we've also lost our ability to stop.</p><p>We bounced off the dock (ouch) and started blowing toward a moored mega yacht. Missing that by a couple of feet, we got a tiny bit of anchor down. Luckily it was enough to hold, but little enough that our dangerous swinging kept us from hitting two nearby anchored boats. Somewhere in there was a mad dash to reset a tripped breaker for the windlass, but it was so fast that I don't now where in the process that happened.</p><p>Once we ascertained that we were more or less safe, I went for a swim and sawed the prop free.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The liberated fishing net" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">The liberated fishing net</span></a><p>From there, we were able to get back to the fuel dock, fill up, and get to a med moor for the stay.</p><p>As soon as I went to the marina office, I knew we were out of Europe. The breeze was warm instead of cool. The whole area was lively, and there was music playing. It turned out that there was music everywhere -- the sounds of live bands singing in Portugese or in their Creole filtered out into the streets at night. And in the day, you could walk through streets and hear rehearsal wafting through a window.</p><p>On top of that, the people were very nice, there is boat service by very competent people at the best prices I've seen. Food and drinks were cheap too.<br><br>Before we even officially checked in to the country, I scheduled the boat repair that we needed, and an unbidden laundry lady showed up to handle our sweaty clothes.

When we pulled out into the bay, we pulled into a pretty thick fog bank. For a little bit, we were going to find a spot close to shore to anchor. But as we motored toward a spot that I picked out on the chart, the visibility got a little better, so we inched forward very slowly.</p><p>It was kind of eerie. We were constantly passing the shape of huge container ships outlined in the fog, accompanied by the music of various ship horns sounding near and far.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Foggy at Gibraltar" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">Foggy at Gibraltar</span></a><p>Vanya and I were at the stern (back of the boat) coiling lines and putting away fenders. He saw the big mammel lift up out of the water right beside him. I didn't turn until I heard it take a breath, and I saw a huge black curve, longer than our boat is wide sliding back down into the deeper water.<br><br>I was right by the helm, and I threw the boat into hard reverse. <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/orca-strating-a-passage/">This was a manuever I've been mentally practicing for months</a>.</p><p>She (I'm going with female but who knows) didn't show herself again, and she didn't bump the boat at all. My heart, on the other hand, pounded as hard as it ever has for a good half hour.<br><br>The intense day was just getting underway. As soon as we got out into the open water, a huge ferry was zooming towards us at a speed faster than boats should go, even while sounding their fog horn. That was the beginning of several hours of constantly calculating where giant ships would be, while they all traveled at slightly different speeds and angles. We were under sail downwind in a strong blow, and we couldn't maneuver freely due to fear of an accidental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibe">jibe</a>.</p><p>I need to back up and talk about why were in Spain rather than in Gibraltar to begin with. Cruising rumor has it that there's a marina in Gibralter with big private bath tubs, and that is very appealing to me.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2118.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="I'm not sure why this rock is so famous.

This is a treaty amongst most of the EU countries (and maybe a few that aren't EU) that lets you check in to Europe and just bounce from country to country without going through customs and immigration at every new place. Americans are allowed 90 days inside of Schengen out of every 180, and our time is pretty much up.</p><p>We went to Spain to clear out, and save our remaining few days to legally tour the Canary Islands, which are also part of Spain. But it turns out that when we exported the boat from Slovenia, they also stamped us out of the country in our passports. We didn't know, and we didn't check in on the next stop, so we had been travelling illegally since the first week of February.</p><p>The Spanish border police were very nice. They conferred amongst themselves for a little while and then just decided to stamp us in as if we had just shown up by boat, and then stamp us right back out. It took us longer to find the right building than it did to get our passports straight. My catch phrase for them is "No lines, no fines, no jail time!"<br><br>Now, we're headed South along the Moroccan coast. Once we turned the corner and were in the Atlantic Ocean looking at Africa, everything changed. It went from cold to warm, the wind died down, and insects showed up. All of that in the space of an hour.

They have various degrees of convenience and amenities, but all of them are a step down when compared to our quarters aboard the boat.</p><p>We have mostly just been doing work, school, and streaming American TV. We wander the town, and we're a little tired of every bar and restaurant. We've come to know a healthy percentage of the local British population, just from happening to be seated near them at cocktail hour one night or another. Last Thursday, we went to a random going away party, and it happened to be an outgoing dog lover who had introduced herself to Rosie and then to the rest of us at a different place earlier in the stay.</p><p>The wind continues to blow us away, in both the literal and figurative senses. We turned the Pegasus crew loose to make their way home after they had worked around the clock for 10 days or so, leaving me to roll on a couple of coats of bottom paint. I did it in the wind, and the gale would lift sheets of paint up out of my paint tray and blow it over my head and face. Last Tuesday, I was too paint-covered to drop in and see my Scottish friend perform at the Irish Pub's open mic night.</p><p>Easter weekend brought our first real rain, and we huddled in our tiniest apartment to watch movies. I'm not sure if it's one of our most memorable or least memorable Easters.</p><p>We should be able to put in on April Fool's day and get moving again after a day of sail-hoisting and cleanup.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240322_220041_2389FB71-5741-4E34-B019-F54A7CF4E173_1_105_c.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Killing time at the British Pub, the Stumble Inn." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240322_220041_2389FB71-5741-4E34-B019-F54A7CF4E173_1_105_c.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240322_220041_2389FB71-5741-4E34-B019-F54A7CF4E173_1_105_c.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Killing time at the British Pub, the Stumble Inn.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240323_180050_926483A2-66A3-4B45-9FE7-F3FE72A7A27B_1_105_c.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Blowing like hell." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240323_180050_926483A2-66A3-4B45-9FE7-F3FE72A7A27B_1_105_c.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240323_180050_926483A2-66A3-4B45-9FE7-F3FE72A7A27B_1_105_c.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Blowing like hell.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240324_140648_8AF3D072-6D9F-47B2-A9A8-6E3CCC8645FB_1_105_c.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Saharan dust blowing in with the wind storm.

We kept moving along the southern Spanish coast in reasonable winds. But the winds had just been really blowing for several days, and the sea state was still pretty agressive.</p><p>By morning, we came to realize that we had some damage. We stopped at Almiramar, where we had planned to stop for a day or two anyway. But instead of leaving, we went ahead and had the boat hauled out of the water for inspection. We found a problem with the potential to be quite serious.</p><p>The good people from Pegasus were on site to help in a day, and they sent a team of experts from their shop with a truck full of supplies immediately. There are three guys working every hour of daylight right now, and we're optimistic about getting back underway next week.</p><p>Meanwhile, we play tourist in Almiramar. There's a huge English-speaking contingent here, and everyone has been very nice. The town is basically a giant zig-zagging marina, surrounded by probably 3 miles of bars and restaurants, and then those surrounded by apartment buildings. There are lots of parks, and the weather is sunny and nice. Each end of town ends in a large beach, but the water is still pretty cold. We're getting a lot of work and school done. But that's about it: work/school, check on the boat, go for dinner and cocktails. There's really not a lot more to do.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I've definitely seen uglier boat yards." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">I've definitely seen uglier boat yards.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240315_141800_D3093609-5AB6-4864-AE23-CADBFE324A11.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We rented an apartment for our stay.

On Saturday, we stopped into a sardine festival, intending to stay an hour or two, but actually ending up making a day of it. While eating, we chatted up a lady who had moved from the US to Ibiza as a baby with expat parents, and she told us where to drive for the big time scenery.</p><p>On Sunday, we did that drive, and even a little hike.

It's like Miami, if a huge road construction project and windy, cool weather caused a lot of the businesses to close for a bit. You can get anything you want there -- boat services, Indian food, night club action, herpes (presumably). We found a place with excellent food and Sangria, and passed a pleasant few days waiting for a good weather window.</p><p>We chose to leave on a Friday night where the forecast was for 20 knot winds on our beam. It turned out to be a night with 25 knots on the bow, which is a much, much more unpleasant sailing experience. But we plowed through the night with a double-reefed main and a bit of jib flying, with winds gusting to 30.</p><p>The seas kicked up, and it was uncomfortable and annoying, We had some miscommunication about who was latching hatches, so it was also wetter inside the boat than it should be. The waves were enough to spray up over the cabin fairly regularly.</p><p>Here's how it looked from the chart table in the middle of the night. Volume up, if you're where you can.</p><iframe width="872" height="491" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLhMsYtoRgQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Around sunrise, I was just getting up to end my night watch, and the auto pilot went out. We were still 20 miles away from Ibiza, and the wind was still coming from the direction we needed at an insane speed. I started the motor, and we plowed into the chop, hand steering through the cold salt spay for four hours.</p><p>When we arrived, we found that the anchor had shaken loose in storm and pounded the shit out of our bow. Our formerly beautifully painted bow. The shaking had also ripped the door to the forwardmost cabin right out of its frame.<br><br>It's been cold and windy in Ibiza, which doesn't help with the frustration. But in just a few days, we've made a lot of progress on repairs and cleanup, and in a couple more days, we'll be able to move along. A fiberglass guy is going to patch us up "good enough" so that we can move on safely, and then when we're in a place that's warmer and cheaper, we can haul out to complete the repair, sanding, and painting.</p><p>Most of my latest pictures are close ups of hull damage and steering mechanisms.

The marina in Riposto is right by where the the catch comes in every morning, and so just a block down and to the right is market after market of fresh fish right off the boat. We ate tuna and swordfish pretty much every day.</p><p>There was also good produce right there, along with butcher shops, bakeries, and miscellaneous stores with meats and cheeses. I suspect the neighborhood is still abuzz about how much food the American family with teenage boys bought while in town. One lady was shocked -- like, "are you sure you want that much?" -- when I ordered about a pound of mortadella.<br><br>One afternoon, after the fresh markets were closed and I was looking to stock up on wine, a car slowed down near me on the street. Out of the window popped the guy from the produce stand where I had gone three days in a row, and the guy's big booming baritone rang out, "Hello my friend!"</p><p>I hope the local grocery economy will recover quickly now that we are gone.</p><p>(More text after some Sicily photos)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1562.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1562.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1562.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1584.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1584.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1584.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1629.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The size of these peppers!" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1629.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1629.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">The size of these peppers!</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1641.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="If you travel to Sicily, definitely take a tourist boat out to see it from the sea.

We bashed into the wind all day. The sailing wasn't fun, so we tucked into a little cover on a small volcano north of Sicily and got a good night's sleep, followed by a great sail the next day. Another day yet, and we were to Sardinia.</p><p>We chose a marina in a quiet little town that is mostly shut down for the winter. We took a taxi into town and had a five-star meal, but other than that, it was mostly boat chores and laundry. Very pretty though, and it shows signs of being a happening place during the high season.</p><p>(Even more text after these pictures)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Leaving on Saturday, we had ideal conditions for putting out the Code 0 (big, giant downwind sail at the very front of the boat). But I neglected to get any practice on closed-loop furlers, and as I pulled out sail, the furling mechanism was wrapping itself around the sail instead of just unfurling line like a drum furler would have. V and I went forward to get things untangled. but the wind had a good grip on the bit of the sail that had gotten let out. I asked for the boat to be steered into the wind so that the sail would luff, and when the boat turned, it went right over one of the sheets on that sail that was half deployed.</p><p>If you sailed to Cuba with us, or if you heard tales of our Cuba trip, this will sound familiar to you.</p><p>The line got caught in the prop (of course), which means no more motoring. We dropped the big sail to the deck and bungeed it into an ugly bundle. Then, under main sail alone, we sailed close to a pretty little beach and dropped anchor.</p><p>We had to find all of the components of the hookah dive system. I had secretly hoped to never use it again.</p><p>And the best advice that we got before leaving for this trip was to go buy a used wetsuit, just in case.</p><p>We got things sorted, and it took me forever to work up the nerve to swim under water. I kept going under and finding that I couldn't breathe. Eventually, it dawned on me that I was clenching my jaw so tight that I wasn't letting any air out.</p><p>The line wasn't on tight. I just had to unwrap it, maybe seven or eight times. I wasn't under the boat more than 75 seconds or so, probably, but I was nervous like I was diving a blue hole.</p><p>After that, we had a couple of drinks and enjoyed being anchored on a warm afternoon. Then, we put all of the gear back away, wrestled the sail and tangled lines into storage, and set off again. I'm tying this at 4:00 AM local time, and our beautiful weather window is over. There's no wind out here at all.</p><p>At some point, I'll do some technical videos about our sail rigging, but I have a lot left to learn first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/underway</guid><title>Underway</title><description>We shove off and set sail for home.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/underway</link><pubDate>Tue, 6 Feb 2024 14:31:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday morning, we finished buttoning up the boat, motored to the Izola fuel dock, and then motored over to the nearby town of Portrose to officially export the boat from Slovenia.

We had chartered similar boats, and we were excited to do some coastal cruising on our own schedule. As we grew our confidence, we started overnight passages and then venturing farther and farther offshore. And we might have sailed it a bit harder than she was meant to be sailed. Not in a dangerous way, but in the way of robustness.</p><p>I see that clearly now that we've moved aboard Hazagussa, the red Pegasus that you saw briefly in the last post. The Pegasus components -- sailing hardware especially, but pumps, hatches, and all sorts of minor pieces too look and feel so much bigger and sturdier.</p><p>The list of things that I never had to troubleshoot, replace, or repair on the Beneteau is as follows:</p><ul><li>any of the winches</li><li>water heater</li><li>a little pump at the bottom of the freezer to remove meltwater. However, the freezer was broken as often as not, so this pump didn't get put through the paces like the rest of the boat.</li></ul><p>So it's a little bit funny that the boat thing I've done most since we moved aboard is troubleshoot the water heater.</p><p>For most of us, it's not a big deal, because we're at the dock, and hot showers are a short walk away.<br><br>But I don't think I've written yet that one of our capable and able crew, namely Heather, is somewhat less capable with a broken ankle. The marina has accommodated us by allowing us to pull side-to on a long floating dock rather than make her try to cross a gangway. But getting on and off is an adventure, and it's not been the best weather, so she opted for an ice water shower.</p><p>Other than the hot water thing, living aboard again is so great. The salon is big and full of light, and we're all in here without being on top of each other during the rainy days. The cat has find a way to squirm under the salon table, and he has himself a little spot that floats him above strands of cabling. We'll have to put a blanket in that spot for him on Velvet Elvis.</p><p>We even cooked home made food yesterday for the first time since we arrived.</p><p>As I write, it's blowing out there:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32.</span></a><iframe width="1034" height="582" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeep-JfdU-g" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_100038_IMG_1314.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This is one of my favorite pictures that I've ever taken.

We're looking at some time next week before she's in the water, and then there's still a lot to do before we can put Slovenia behind us. But that's the nature of travel, and in particular of sailing. We definitely want everything to be right on the boat first.</p><p>We've gotten to go to the shop and do a lot of technical learning, and seeing how everything is being assembled is invaluable. And we have a company where the owners know where every wire is run and every hose is plumbed, and they seem eager to stay on the phone with us and get us where we want to be when we want to be there. Better yet, they know where to go in the Med and where to skip. It will be great to have them as a remote team helping us from shore.</p><p>We also met the owner of hull 9, <strong>Sine Finis</strong> which launched last week. Nice guy. He's going to leave it here and let us import into the US before following later in the year. I'm sure we'll see hime again.</p><p>Continuing the bad news, we've all been fighting a mild sickness. Fucking air travel. The up side of that is that we just sleep in our rental place, which I've named "the world's most dismal apartment." Tomorrow is move out day. I'll leave the details about where we're going for later in the week.<br><br>My pictures are a weird mix of tourist and technical. Here's a pretty mountain. Here's a compressor for the cockpit refrigerator. Here's the dog looking cute on a Pegasus that is not our Pegasus. I'm a bit at a loss for what to post.</p><p>I think I'm going to do some technical walk-through videos for the real nerds out there once we're aboard our own boat, so I'll save some of those pictures for then.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" data-lightview-caption="How's that for a transom?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-01.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">How's that for a transom?</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-02.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Izola is a really pretty town." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-03.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Izola is a really pretty town.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-04.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Velvet Elvis's keel" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-05.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Velvet Elvis's keel</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/game-plan</guid><title>Game Plan</title><description>It's almost go time.

Here's our plan for the next couple of weeks. Send good vibes for cooperating weather.</p><p>Jan 8: We arrive in Slovenia. Rent car, check in to apartment, buy cat litter.</p><p>Jan 9: Boat school starts. Go to Kranj to see <em>Velvet Elvis</em> in person and start learning her systems. Boat school continues with combinations of visits to the boat yard and on board a sister ship in the marina at Izola.</p><p>Jan 12: Keel arrives at boat yard from the keel manufacturer. Ours is the first Pegasus with the shoal draft keel. This delivery is somewhat delayed, but the good folks at Pegasus are planning to keep it in the shop and do its prep work over the weekend.</p><p>Jan 15: Transport the boat to the ocean. This should be a big day with some good pictures.</p><p>Jan 16th &amp; 17th: Install keel, step the mast, install rigging, and get the boat into the water. Maybe not in that order.</p><p>Once the boat's in the water, we can start unloading the pallets of our stuff that we shipped up there and moving into the boat. We can also get to the starlink dish at this point and get it installed. We also start a series of test sails where we make sure everything is working, instruments are calibrated, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</guid><title>More Photos From the Build</title><description>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</link><pubDate>Thu, 7 Dec 2023 14:36:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2748.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Main cabin is coming along.
