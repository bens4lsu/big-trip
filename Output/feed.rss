Here's our plan for the next couple of weeks. Send good vibes for cooperating weather.</p><p>Jan 8: We arrive in Slovenia. Rent car, check in to apartment, buy cat litter.</p><p>Jan 9: Boat school starts. Go to Kranj to see <em>Velvet Elvis</em> in person and start learning her systems. Boat school continues with combinations of visits to the boat yard and on board a sister ship in the marina at Izola.</p><p>Jan 12: Keel arrives at boat yard from the keel manufacturer. Ours is the first Pegasus with the shoal draft keel. This delivery is somewhat delayed, but the good folks at Pegasus are planning to keep it in the shop and do its prep work over the weekend.</p><p>Jan 15: Transport the boat to the ocean. This should be a big day with some good pictures.</p><p>Jan 16th &amp; 17th: Install keel, step the mast, install rigging, and get the boat into the water. Maybe not in that order.</p><p>Once the boat's in the water, we can start unloading the pallets of our stuff that we shipped up there and moving into the boat. We can also get to the starlink dish at this point and get it installed. We also start a series of test sails where we make sure everything is working, instruments are calibrated, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</guid><title>More Photos From the Build</title><description>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/posts/more-photos-from-the-build</link><pubDate>Thu, 7 Dec 2023 14:36:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2748.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Main cabin is coming along.

They were things like rudders and sections of bulkhead and interior walls. Things that they can cut out a lot of for several boats at a time.</p><p>Some time during August or September, our hull showed up in the shop. At that point, it was just a boat shaped mass of fiber. They start laying in bulkheads and interior walls and start running the hundreds of miles of cabling and wiring, adding water tanks and waste tanks and plumbing, and all of the hundreds of other things that start turning it in to the boat it will be.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2024%20Medium.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Velvet Elvis in the Yard, September 20, 2023" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2024%20Medium.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2024 Medium.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Velvet Elvis in the Yard, September 20, 2023</span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2029%20Medium.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Inside the hull" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2029%20Medium.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2029 Medium.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Inside the hull</span></a><p>On October 27, enough was done to join the deck to the hull</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2276%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2276%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2276 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2282%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2282%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2282 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2283%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2283%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2283 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>As I understand that process, there is much lowering and raising, then sanding and fairing to make sure everything fits together just right.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2284%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2284%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2284 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2287%20Large.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2287%20Large.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_2287 Large.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Meanwhile, we were selecting flooring and fabrics for the interior.

It might seem a little aggressive, but I think there will be some cool things. First, a lot of the instruments live mounted on those surfaces, so they will seem just to float over the surface of the boat itself. Second, some of the sight lines from the cockpit look through the salon glass, and with black, we shouldn't really get any glare from this surface no matter what the light is like.</p><p>Cockpit cushions will be similar, except that the throw pillows will be gold, to better match the trim of the boat itself.</p><p>This isn't her, of course, but this is a render of what a black hull with gold trim should look like.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/color-render-1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/color-render-1.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/color-render-1.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/VelvetElvis_transom.png" data-lightview-caption="And from behind" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://your-website-url.com/img/bigtrip/VelvetElvis_transom.png" alt="/img/bigtrip/VelvetElvis_transom.png" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">And from behind</span></a><p>This week, they're actually going to be painting. It goes on in several coats over the course of a week, and then it cures for a couple of weeks before being covered by something to make it shiny. I think of it as a gelcoat, but it's probably not technically a gelcoat at all. (Or maybe it is.)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
